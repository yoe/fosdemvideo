Notes for 2015
==============

Gear
----

* Must have spare *everything*; cameras, laptops, cables, everything.
* Add UPS for servers

Orga
----

* Need to have a separate room (not sharing with network team anymore)
* Separate software/gear team (h01ger/CarlFK: software; wouter/...: gear)
* Make rounds when things should be up
* Clarify to teams that we *might* be late at startup.
* Clarify what cheat sheet is what (label one "setup", the other
  "operating" cheat sheet)
* Assign a particular person to manage video volunteers (and *nothing* else)
* We had planned to run dvsink-files twice (once to server, once to
  laptops). As such, we had three servers (more than we'd need for
  offline copying) and rented the laptops until the monday after fosdem
  (since copying should've finished by sunday evening). Last-minute
  change of plans meant:
  - Copying files took until late monday
  - One server wasn't used much during event (maybe for transcoding?)
  - Waste of money for an extra server and for extra laptop rental
* Preparing at the NixSys office won't be an option for next year:
  - NixSys is moving at the end of Q1 2014
  - The office is not large enough to run 20+ laptops concurrently
  - It is quite a logistical effort to get everything from rental
    companies to Mechelen to ULB to Mechelen to rental companies again.

  The above combined mean we would need space which would ideally be:
  - Within walking distance of a hotel or other accomodation for video
    team members (so we don't need to worry about transportation and can
    work until the wee hours of the night if needs be),
  - Within a reasonable distance of the ULB (so moving gear from that
    location to ULB and back isn't an issue for the logistics people)
  - Ours for at least a week before the event, and a few days after,
  - A place with a clear address so we can have rental companies
    deliver gear there,
  - With decent Internet connectivity (doesn't need to be gigabit
    Internet link, but we need to be able to install several laptops
    from the Internet, and need to communicate with people not there
    over IRC or mail or the likes),
  - Large enough and have a stable enough power infrastructure to run
    two laptops plus a camera plus a framegrabber per room concurrently
    as well as seat four to five people with their laptops, so that we
    can test our full setup.
