Notes for 2015
==============

Gear
----

* Must have spare *everything*; cameras, laptops, cables, everything.
* Add UPS for servers

Orga
----

* Need to have a separate room (not sharing with network team anymore)
* Separate software/gear team (h01ger/CarlFK: software; wouter/...: gear)
* Make rounds when things should be up
* Clarify to teams that we *might* be late at startup.
* Clarify what cheat sheet is what (label one "setup", the other "operating" cheat sheet)
* Assign a particular person to manage video volunteers (and *nothing* else)
* We had planned to run dvsink-files twice (once to server, once to
  laptops). As such, we had three servers (more than we'd need for
  offline copying) and rented the laptops until the monday after fosdem
  (since copying should've finished by sunday evening). Last-minute
  change of plans meant:
  - Copying files took until late monday
  - One server wasn't used much during event (maybe for transcoding?)
  - Waste of money for an extra server and for extra laptop rental
