# Transcoding TODO

- Cross-distro (H1302_Depage): audio missing
- http://veypar.nextdayvideo.com:8080/main/overlaping_files/173/ contains DVs from two
  instances of dvsink-files running at the same time, needs to be fixed
- http://veyepar.nextdayvideo.com:8080/main/overlaping_episodes/173/
  contains overlapping talks (from penta), so need to be manually
  reviewed.
- minix on arm (Lameere) starts with ~10 minutes of speaker waiting
